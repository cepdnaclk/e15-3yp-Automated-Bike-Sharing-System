## Introduction  

  



Today vehicles are a huge problem in the world, starting from the environment pollution arranging parking space causes deforestation. Moreover, people donâ€™t have enough time to workout and to attend a gym. Therefore Today, more than 600 cities and more than 200 universities around the globe have their own bike-share systems, and more programs are starting every year. The largest systems are in China, in cities such as Hangzhou and Shanghai. In Paris, London, and Washington, D.C. highly successful systems have helped to promote cycling as a viable and valued transport option. Bike-share has taken many forms over the course of its development, from free bikes left for a community to use at will to more technologically advanced and secure systems.

As the most of the universities have a wide area of land, transportation within the university causes the time to waste, accidents, congestion because of using the private vehicles, parking problems and the energy consumption related to the mobility of workers and students of the universities. The bicycle sharing programs have received increasing attention in recent years with initiatives to increase bike usage, better meet the demand of a more mobile public and lessen the environmental impacts of our transportation activities. So, the project aims to introduce automated bike sharing system to minimize the above impacts while evaluating the mobility patterns of academic campuses and assessing the energy consumption and pollutant emissions produced by the universities. This system provides the users to unlock the chosen bicycle in the substations via a mobile app and start riding, check the availability of bicycles and authorized people to track the path of rides of all users.
